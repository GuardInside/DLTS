# Test parameters #

# Ea = 560 [meV]
# sigma = 7e-15 [cm^2]
# Constant capacity = 1.0 [pF] for all temperature points.

# full.dlts consist of relaxations in range from 240 to 310 K with 1 K step.
# rarefied.dlts consist of relaxations with temperatures [270, 285, 290, 300, 310] K.
# single.dlts consist of relaxations with temperature 270 K.
